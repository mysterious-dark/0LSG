# Game Overview
A mobile game developed in Godot Engine, designed for one-handed play focusing on simple interactions through buttons and area controls.

## Core Game Phases

### 1. Main GUI (Hub Phase)
- Primary interface where players spend most of their time
- Should be easily navigable with one hand
- Requirements:
  - Clear, easily tappable buttons
  - Intuitive layout for one-handed operation
  - Quick access to all other game phases
  - Status/progress indicators

### 2. Visual Story Phase
- Story-driven content with animations
- Requirements:
  - Simple tap/swipe controls for story progression
  - Character/scene animations
  - Text display system
  - Possible choices/branching system
  - Skip/fast-forward functionality

### 3. Customization/Planning Phase ("My Room")
Features:

## Technical Requirements
- Platform: Mobile (Android/iOS)
- Engine: Godot
- Input: Touch-based, one-handed operation
- Screen Orientation: TBD (Recommend portrait for one-handed play)

## Development Priorities
1. Set up basic navigation between all four phases
2. Implement core UI framework
3. Develop basic systems for each phase
4. Add content and polish

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create initial project structure in Godot
- [ ] Design UI mockups for each phase
- [ ] Implement basic scene transitions
- [ ] Create prototype of each phase
- [ ] Test one-handed usability

## Notes
- All UI elements should be positioned for comfortable one-handed operation
- Consider thumb reachability zones for button placement
- Implement a save system for progress retention
- Ensure all interactive elements are large enough for mobile touch input
